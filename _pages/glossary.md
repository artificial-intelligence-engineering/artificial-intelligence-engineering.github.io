            Foundation models, sometimes known as base models, are powerful artificial intelligence (AI) models that are 
            trained on a massive amount of data and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks. They serve as the base or 
            building blocks for crafting more specialized applications. These more specialized applications are the
            main task for the AI Engineering teams.

            The term "foundation model" was coined by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence 
            (HAI) in 2021.

            Large Language Model (LLM) is the technical term and conceptually the beginning of the named Foundation Models.
            A Large Language Model (LLM) is a specific, advanced type of machine learning model used within the broader 
            field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is the overall field that enables computers to understand 
            and process human language, while an LLM is huge trained model for achieving many NLP tasks, such as generating 
            text, translation, and summarization, by using deep learning on massive datasets.
